## Overview

The **Smart City Traffic Analysis Project** aims to forecast traffic patterns and optimize traffic signal timings at various junctions in a smart city using machine learning techniques. The project also simulates emergency vehicle routing and integrates computer vision to count vehicles for a more dynamic and adaptive traffic management system.

## Project Structure


## Features

- **Traffic Data Analysis**: Importing and cleaning traffic data from various city junctions.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Using Random Forest Regression to predict optimal green light timings based on traffic volume and emergency vehicle frequency.
- **Adaptive Traffic Light Algorithm**: A dynamic system for adjusting traffic lights in real-time, accounting for traffic volume and emergency vehicle presence.
- **Emergency Vehicle Simulation**: Simulating emergency vehicle routing and prioritization in the traffic system.
- **Computer Vision Integration**: Counting vehicles at junctions using computer vision techniques.

## Methodology

### Week 1
- Imported and cleaned traffic data from city junctions.
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand traffic patterns.

### Week 2
- Developed a Random Forest model to predict green light timings.
- Introduced emergency vehicle simulation with a 6% event probability.
- Implemented an adaptive green signal timeout algorithm.

### Week 3
- Integrated computer vision to count vehicles at junctions.
- Analyzed model predictions and identified dataset limitations.

### Week 4
- Expanded the dataset with realistic peak-hour traffic variations.
- Re-trained the model with improved data, showing better performance.

## Results

- **Increased Accuracy**: The updated model showed lower Mean Squared Error (MSE), resulting in more accurate traffic light predictions.
- **Real-World Simulation**: Simulated peak hour traffic with emergency vehicle occurrences for a more dynamic model.
- **Adaptive Traffic System**: Successfully created an adaptive green light timing system based on real-time traffic conditions.

## Challenges

- **Dataset Limitations**: The original dataset lacked real-world variability, which led to uniform model predictions.
- **Emergency Vehicle Data**: No real emergency vehicle data was available, so a probabilistic simulation was introduced.
